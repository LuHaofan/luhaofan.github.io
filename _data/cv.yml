    - title: WiFi Physical Layer security loopholes and their implications
      year: Spet. 2021-present
      description: 
        - Reveal that WiFi Physical layer replies ACK to any packet, even those coming out of the network.
        - Reveal that WiFi Physical layer power-saving mechanism can be manipulated by fake beacon packets.
        - Investigate the possible security implications of these loopholes, including the disclosure of sensitive information, such as breathing rate; battery drainage of important IoT devices, such as security cameras.
