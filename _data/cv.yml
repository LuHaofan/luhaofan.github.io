    - title: WiFi Physical Layer security loopholes and their implications
      year: Spet. 2021-present
      description: 
        - Reveal that WiFi Physical layer replies ACK to any packet, even those coming out of the network.
        - Reveal that WiFi Physical layer power-saving mechanism can be manipulated by fake beacon packets.
        - Investigate the possible security implications of these loopholes, including the disclosure of sensitive information, such as breathing rate; battery drainage of important IoT devices, such as security cameras.

    - title: WiFi Localization for IoT devices with a single RF chain
      year: March 2022-present
      description:
        - Investigate the WiFi Probing Mechanism and combine it with the Frequency Scanning Antenna (FSA) technique for Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) measurement.
        - Develop Time-of-Flight (ToF) based ranging techniques that achieve sub-meter level accuracy on ESP32 platform.
        - Combine ToF and AoA information to enable localization for devices with a single RF chain.
