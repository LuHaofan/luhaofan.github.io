I am currently a second year PhD student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/) at [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/), advised by [Professor Omid Abari](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~omid/).

My current research interest is in wireless sensing and communication systems, especially millimeter wave backscattering communication and machine learning for more efficient wireless systems.

Before joining UCLA, I received a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering with highest honor from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/), and a Bachelor of Engineering degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). It's a dual-degree undergrad program by [ZJU-UIUC Institute](https://zjui.intl.zju.edu.cn/en).
