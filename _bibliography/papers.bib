  abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology enables wireless devices to communicate using very high-frequency signals. Operating at those frequencies provides larger bandwidth which can be used to enable high-data-rate links, and very accurate localization of devices. However, radios operating at high-frequencies consume significant amount of power, making them unsuitable for applications with limited energy sources. This paper presents MilBack, a backscatter network operating at mmWave bands. Backscattering is the most energy-efficient wireless communication technique, where nodes piggyback their data on an access point's signal instead of generating their own signals. Eliminating the need for signal generation significantly reduces the energy-consumption of the nodes. In contrast to past mmWave backscatter work which supports only uplink, MilBack is the first mmWave backscatter network which supports uplink, downlink and accurate localization. MilBack addresses the key challenges that prevent existing backscatter networks to enable both uplink and downlink at mmWave bands. We implemented MilBack and evaluated its performance empirically. Our results show that MilBack is capable of achieving accurate localization, uplink and downlink communication at up to 10 m while consuming only 32 mW and 18 mW, respectively.}

  abstract={WiFi communication should be possible only between devices inside the same network. However, we find that all existing WiFi devices send back acknowledgments (ACK) to even fake packets received from unauthorized WiFi devices outside of their network. Moreover, we find that an unauthorized device can manipulate the power-saving mechanism of WiFi radios and keep them continuously awake by sending specific fake beacon frames to them. Our evaluation of over 5,000 devices from 186 vendors confirms that these are widespread issues. We believe these loopholes cannot be prevented, and hence they create privacy and security concerns. Finally, to show the importance of these issues and their consequences, we implement and demonstrate two attacks where an adversary performs battery drain and WiFi sensing attacks just using a tiny WiFi module which costs less than ten dollars.}

  abstract={Recent years have seen significant advances in WiFi Localization. However, existing systems require either multiple access points to cooperate with each other or a single access point to have multiple antennas and transceiver chains. Therefore, they cannot be integrated into most IoT WiFi chipsets which have only a single transceiver chain. This paper presents \name, a novel approach to bringing WiFi localization to any WiFi devices, especially those with a single RF chain. We propose a WiFi antenna design and use the inherent properties of the 802.11 protocol to measure Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and Time-of-Flight (ToF) using a single transceiver chain. Our proof-of-concept simulation and real world experiments promise the feasibility of this approach. }

  abstract={The effective medium theories (EMTs) can reliably approximate the property of a composite using properties of the inclusion and matrix phase. However, their inherent assumptions and the availability of mathematical forms for describing the inclusion structure limit their accuracy and applicability. In this work, we utilize the capabilities of a deep learning method to ameliorate the latter restriction for a particular EMT formulation. Our deep learning models elucidate the inclusion structure using several physics-based descriptors and can be easily adapted for other inclusion shapes through transfer learning. Using our models, we shed light on the interpretation of the shape factor in the chosen EMT. More importantly, we extend, not replace, the EMT for cases beyond its original formulation. Our proposed transfer learning approach requires relatively low computation cost and a small sample number, making it especially useful when new data is limited.}
