  abstract={Recent years have seen significant advances in WiFi Localization. However, existing systems require either multiple access points to cooperate with each other or a single access point to have multiple antennas and transceiver chains. Therefore, they cannot be integrated into most IoT WiFi chipsets which have only a single transceiver chain. This paper presents \name, a novel approach to bringing WiFi localization to any WiFi devices, especially those with a single RF chain. We propose a WiFi antenna design and use the inherent properties of the 802.11 protocol to measure Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) and Time-of-Flight (ToF) using a single transceiver chain. Our proof-of-concept simulation and real world experiments promise the feasibility of this approach. }

  abstract={The effective medium theories (EMTs) can reliably approximate the property of a composite using properties of the inclusion and matrix phase. However, their inherent assumptions and the availability of mathematical forms for describing the inclusion structure limit their accuracy and applicability. In this work, we utilize the capabilities of a deep learning method to ameliorate the latter restriction for a particular EMT formulation. Our deep learning models elucidate the inclusion structure using several physics-based descriptors and can be easily adapted for other inclusion shapes through transfer learning. Using our models, we shed light on the interpretation of the shape factor in the chosen EMT. More importantly, we extend, not replace, the EMT for cases beyond its original formulation. Our proposed transfer learning approach requires relatively low computation cost and a small sample number, making it especially useful when new data is limited.}
